This repository demonstrates a race condition bug in Firebase Cloud Firestore transactions and provides a solution. The bug arises when multiple clients attempt to update the same document concurrently based on a conditional check. This can lead to inconsistent data updates. The solution uses a retry mechanism to ensure that the transaction's conditions are evaluated against the most up-to-date document state.  The 'bug.js' file showcases the problematic code, while 'bugSolution.js' presents the improved solution.
